# Archaeological Predictive Modeling of Chumash Cultural Sites

This repository contains the code associated with the Archaeological Predictive Modeling project on the Barbare√±o Chumash in the Santa Barbara Area. The goal of this project was to create a predictive model using logistic regression to identify areas of archaeological interest, by using known sites and their geography at Point Conception, California.
